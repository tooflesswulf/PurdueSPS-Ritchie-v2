This is ritchie now

Decided to use `python` over `node.js` for several reasons
- Python powerful
- Native decorators are clean
- `discord.py` Cogs aren't really mirrored by `discord.js` or `eris`
- pickle is really nice tbh

Reasons I might change back to `node.js`
- `Promise.then().catch()` is way more stable & explicit than checking `NoneType`
- Typescript hints are really really nice
- `discord.py` type hints are a fat mess
